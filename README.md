# ATM System with DB implemented

*You need to add the DB to your SSMS since its not a hosted DB (Its the AtmDB.bak file)*

Simple system that you can:
- Create new bank account;
- Login;
- Check balance;
- Add money;
- Withdraw money. 

Its not very pretty and organized/optimized but oh well.

It may have a few(many) bugs and may malfunction on your side since its not a project that I focused on, it was only for practice.

If you find any bugs feel free to hmu on discord PerkZz#0001 even tho this is not a big project that needs bugs solved lol.

<h3>Yes yes it may have a few grammatical errors, but im pretty lazy to correct them.</h3>
