# ATM System with DB implemented

*You need to add the DB to your SSMS since its not a hosted DB (Its the AtmDB.bak file)*

Simple system that you can:
- Create new bank account;
- Login;
- Check balance;
- Add money;
- Withdraw money. 

Its not very pretty and organized/optimized but oh well.

It may have a few(many) bugs and may malfunction on your side since its not a project that I focused on, it was only for practice.

I was thinking of showing everything inside the atm but it would take alot of time to manage such thing lol.But yeah might come back to this and add more futures and make more "real" and optimized.

If you find any bugs feel free to hmu on discord PerkZz#0001

<h3>Yes yes it may have a few grammatical errors like you can see on the video, but im pretty lazy to correct them.</h3>
