# ATM System with DB implemented

You need to add the DB to your SSMS since its not a hosted DB (Its the Atmscript.sql)

Simple system that you can create new bank account, login, check balance, add money and withdraw money. Its not very pretty and not very organized/optimized but oh well.
It may have a few(many) bugs and may malfunction on your side since its not a project that I focused on, it was only for practice, if you find any bug feel free to hmu on discord PerkZz#0001

Yes yes it may have a few grammatical errors like you can see on the video, but im pretty lazy to correct them.
